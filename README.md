# Project Document



## Your final outcome:
- You will build your first *dynamic* **web application** combining all of the CS tools you learned so far!


## Project Plan:
In this challenge, a [Company] of your choosing has approached you looking for a new web application!  
The company can be an organization you like, a restaurant you visit frequently, or any other one on your mind.  

The company asks for: 
- 3 main pages: Landing page, an about us page, and a page containing a form (can be login/logout, reviews section, contact us section, etc.)
- The form should be linked to a database.
- The web application should run on Flask.



## Official Requirements:
Final Outcome:
- At least 3 HTML pages - Focus on User Interactivity/Friendliness 
- Uses Flask (Routing & Forms)
- Databases implemented. (Try to use CRUD)


### Bonus:
- Uses Bootstrap
- Uses an API

### Should be submitted with: 
- Planning Document (Must have)
- Storyboard & Wireframe *(if any)*



## Why should you care?
You learned about Front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test!  
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.
This is your chance to show us what you’re passionate about using CS only, you can show off your skills and still focus on your website’s topic using your creativity!  


## Collaboration:  
  
***Pair* Programming** is a really important skill.  
I know sometimes it’s uncomfortable to work in groups, but as a developer, you work together all the time.  
When you build an app, you will never be building and creating by yourself. You might be using a blog post, or a stack overflow question, or asking a friend and in some capacity you will be working with other people.  
There is a concept called **pair programming** that’s used in industry, where *two developers* work together on <u>one computer</u>.  
One is **the driver**, who types, and the other is **the navigator** who tells the driver what to type.  
It should be a conversation, we should hear talking in the room when you work together, it should be **collaborative**.  
A lot of tech companies use **pair programming** during the interview process to see if you can get along with their developers. It’s a really important skill to be able to *work together*.  


### >>> 1 + 1 = 3
> When does this happen?  
</br>  

This happens as a result to **Effective Collaboration!**  

> The **whole** is *greater* than the **sum** of its parts.  
  
- Turn to your partner, "what does it mean to be an effective collaborator?"  
</br>  

Some effective collaboration ***characteristics***:
- listening
- humility
- patience
- compassion
- generosity
- empathy
- clarity and thoughtful communication
- joy  
</br>  


## Brainstorming:  
1. Brainstorm a topic the website revolves around and decide on the company/service you are building a web application for.
- Can be on paper & pen or a tool of your choice. *Make sure to save your documentation somewhere safe as you'll have to submit it!*

### Hypothetical Projects You could do! (To get your brain running)
+ A web application for a restaurant that has a reviews form, where the customers can rate the restaurant after visiting it.
+ A web application for an organization that has a login/signup page for the organization employees/members.
+ A web application for a cleaning service that has a contact form so the users can send requests easily to the cleaning crew.


### Project Samples: (Also to get your brain running)

- [One Direction Fans](https://directioner.herokuapp.com/)  


## Storyboarding & Wireframing:
1. Draw the storyboards and wireframe of your different pages!  
- Can be on paper & pen or a wireframing tool of your choice (such as [NinjaMock](https://ninjamock.com/)).
- For getting a color scheme, here's a [useful website](https://coolors.co/)  
- Wireframe example:

## Building/Workflow:
1. Brainstorming
2. Writing down your plan *(must)*, Storyboarding & Wireframing *(optional)* + Choosing a color scheme *(optional)*
3. Implementation (Coding + building everything together)
